Hey!

I finished a couple days ago, the "Music" page. For the moment it only a current playing track and my top 10 most played songs from Spotify. The "Now playing" section *kinda* works, because once I deploy a new version, it only shows the song that was playing at the time when I deployed and it can't be updated. I will be working on that later this week.

Also, I will upload a **new video** about doing this page: how to work with the API, manage the secret keys on your Github repository and displaying the information on your web. Possibly there will be a post related to the video before you upload it to YouTube, just to have it also in text and not only in video.

I should have posted it already but I didn't have time this weekend, so I will post it next weekend.

So nothing, thanks once again for reading me and have a good week. Bye!
