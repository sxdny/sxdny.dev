I really think that being consistent in everything is the key. Whether in sports, content creation, learning a skill, whatever.

For example, the last 3 - 4 months I have been trying to study Maths (to improve my overall grade) for at least 1 hour from,  the most basic to the most complex things.

At the beggining, when I went through all the pages of the book I use to study, I thought I couldn't learn everything in the book or get to the more complex parts. But now that I realize, I'm already at a very advanced level (or at least I think so).

And all this is thanks to the fact that I have dedicated myself every day to at least 1 hour of study every day.

I would be lying if I told you that I haven't missed a single day, but the fact that I set my mind to it has changed everything and that's why I think consistency is so important.

So if you are trying to be great at something, learn a new skill or whatever, one of the most important things that you have to know is that *you have to be consistent*.
