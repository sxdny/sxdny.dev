Hello!

Everyone has goals and important things to do everyday. When i was at High School, I thought that writing things down on paper or simply taking notes from the teacher presentations and keynotes was for nerds and that I didn't need that.

But one day, I noticed that my brain can't handle most of the information I needed to remember or store for my exams. So I started to think: **"How do I remember ALL these things?"**

Since that day, I always tried to improve the way that I take notes and study for exams until last year, that I discovered (thanks to YouTube) a couple Apps and Programs that I could install on my phone.

So, here's my personal list of **Apps to boost your productivity:**

## 1. Obsidian / Notion

- [Obsidian (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=md.obsidian&hl=es&gl=US)
- [Obsidian (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/obsidian-connected-notes/id1557175442)
- [Notion (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=notion.id&hl=es&gl=US)
- [Notion (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/notion-notas-tareas/id1232780281)

These two are both great apps for taking notes.

**Notion** is more focused on notes for projects and teams while **Obsidian** for power note-takers and people who want to store a lot of information.

I personally preffer Obsidian because it includes a lot of tools to link your information and see those links, you can install plugins from the community to improve your experience on the app and a lot more!

## 2. Google Tasks.

- [Google Tasks (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tasks&hl=es&gl=US)
- [Google Tasks (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/google-tasks-get-things-done/id1353634006)

This is a Google App for writing down todo lists and reminders.

I use this one because its linked to my Google account, something that is very important to me.

There's also another alternatives like Todoist and the default reminder app for your phone, but I never did stick to it.

## 3. Google Calendar

- [Google Calendar (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.calendar&hl=es&gl=US)
- [Google Calendar (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/google-calendar-planificador/id909319292)

The Calendar app of Google. 

Just like Google Taks, I only use this one because it's linked to my Google Account. I didn't find yet a special feature on this App that other apps don't have, but it's a great app.

## 4. Noice

- [Noice (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.ashutoshgngwr.noice&hl=es&gl=US)
- Not on the App Store

This app allows you to but a lot of different noises to study and relax.

It's free, the noises are cool and they have a very good quality and you can also mix them and make your "playlists" of noises.

Very cool and really recommended.
