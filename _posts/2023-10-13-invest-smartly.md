I just finished reading a very interesting article by Stephen Ango, called *Buy wisely*.

He basically says that is better to invest in some expensive things that are more durable and important to us, than just buying cheap products that in the long term will need to be replaced.

In that post, he shares a heuristic called *Cost per use*, which helps us choosing the right things to invest on.

To use it, first you need to know how many times you will use the product and how often.

Then, you will need to assess the durability of the product. In order to do that, here are some question to help you:

- Will it be as useful to me in the future as it is now?
- Is it made of durable and maintainable materials?
- Does it have a timeless style and aesthetic?
- Does it age well?
- Does it retain its resale value? Would someone else want to own it?
- Can it be disassembled and repaired?
- Does it have replaceable, non-proprietary parts that are easy to acquire?
- Can it be powered with a standard plug or replaceable batteries?
- Can it be modified and upgraded?
- Has the maker existed for at least as long as I hope to keep the product?
- Can it perform many jobs, or only one?
- Does it have a guarantee?
- Does it rely on other products or technologies that aren’t durable?

Not everything has to fill all the boxes, but is it better if they do or at least, the majority of them.

I will try to apply this idea now that I need to buy a couple of things (and I barely have money).

Being real, I don't have any money (yet).

Hope this helps you, bless you and have a good day!
